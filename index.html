        <p class="section-sab-tag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. Its precise definition is disputed and there are disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what extent education is different from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people and the academic field studying educational phenomena.

        <p class="section-sab-tag text-small">The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various fields.[1] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving goals like the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.[2] However, there is extensive debate regarding its exact nature beyond these general features. One approach is to view education as a process that occurs during educational events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.[3] Another outlook understands education not as a process but as the product resulting from this process. It emphasizes the mental states and dispositions of educated persons.[4] Additionally, the term may also refer to the academic field that studies the methods, processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning.[5] Having a clear idea of what the term means is important to correctly identify educational phenomena. It also matters when trying to measure or improve them.[6] The term "education" is derived from the Latin words educare, meaning "to bring up, rear, educate" in relation to the mind, and educere, meaning "to bring out, lead forth" in reference to the bodily level.[7][8]

          Some theorists provide precise definitions by identifying the specific features that are exclusive to all forms of education. Education theorist R. S. Peters, for instance, outlines three essential features of education:[9]
         <ul> 
          <li> It is concerned with the transmission of knowledge and understanding.</li>
          <li>This transmission is worthwhile.</li>
          <li>It is done in a morally appropriate manner in tune with the student's interests.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="section-sab-tag text-small">The most common division is between formal, non-formal, and informal education.[29][a] Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework. Such frameworks have a chronological and hierarchical order: the modern schooling system has classes based on the student's age and progress, extending all the way from primary school to university. Formal education is usually controlled and guided by the government. It tends to be compulsory up to a certain age.[31]

          Non-formal and informal education take place outside the formal schooling system. Non-formal education is a middle ground. Like formal education, it is organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear purpose in mind. </p>
